#Requires -Version 7.4
# Break Bad Deploy: Ship a bad config rollout that regresses the product listing.
#
# Scenario 4 — Bad Deploy / Rollback (deployment-signal correlation).
#
# This simulates the most common real-world incident: a regression introduced by
# a deployment, not by infra. We flip the app's FAULT_INJECT env var to 500 via
# `kubectl set env`, which mutates the Deployment's pod template and triggers a
# NEW rollout revision. That revision IS the deployment signal — the agent is
# expected to correlate the 5xx spike with `kubectl rollout history` / KubeEvents
# and roll back with `kubectl rollout undo` (the fix script does the same).
#
# Detection reuses the existing Zava-http-5xx-errors scheduled-query alert (it
# counts failed AppRequests over the window). No external load generator needed:
# the in-cluster 1 Hz
# self-probe already hits GET /api/products, so once that route returns 500 the
# failed-request count crosses the threshold on its own. The liveness AND readiness
# probes both hit /livez (shallow, no DB), and /api/health stays green too, so pods stay Running and
# only the app route regresses — exactly the "looks healthy at the platform layer
# but the app is broken" shape that makes deployment correlation the key signal.
#
# AKS is a PRIVATE cluster — every K8s op runs through `az aks command invoke`
# (via Invoke-AksCommand), the same path the SRE Agent uses for remediation.
